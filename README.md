## **General presentation**  

It is an operating system for the CC:tweaked mod (a fork of ComputerCraft) that provides a graphical interface.  
The program is written in Lua and covers some of the functions of a real operating system.  
**NOT all** features are supported. Fortunately, you can easily program and integrate your own applications into the OS (see wiki).  
All features will be supported in CubixOS 2.0:
